# Slider with active with thumbnails test

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/_Stef/pen/azqawa](https://codepen.io/_Stef/pen/azqawa).

I'm using slick carousel (http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) on various areas of a site I'm building.

In one place I'm using it to for a slider gallery with thumbnails.
It appears to be working ok, but I think my JS is pretty rusty / clumsy and could definitely be improved upon.
