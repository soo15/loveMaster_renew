          HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines
          the content of a webpage along with the basic layout of the webpage. Other technologies besides HTML
          are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation(CSS) or functionality/
          behavior(JavaScript).

          JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight interpreted or JIT-compiled programming language with first-class
          functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
          environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
          prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and
          declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
